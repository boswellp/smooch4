Files to serve Smooch Web Messenger 4 for the FIDICbot on Messenger, etc. See <a href="http://www.fidic.tips/fidicbot/chatbot.html">FIDICbot</a>.
I felt at first that one cannot serve the Smooch files from gitraw since there is a post to /appusers/upgrade in smooch_4_0_0d_frame.js. Right now this seems not to be a problem.
