Files to serve Smooch Web Messenger 4 for the FIDICbot on Messenger, etc. See <a href="http://www.fidic.tips/fidicbot/">FIDICbot</a>.
Cannot serve the Smooch files from gitraw since there is a post to /appusers/upgrade in smooch_4_0_0a_frame.js. Need to have another look at this. For now, serve the files from fidic.tips.
